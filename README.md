# MoveIt!

MoveIt! is a simple text-based command game where players type commands to control a circle on the screen. The player can move the circle left, right, make it jump, or change its color.
The game integrates Python, Pygame for the interface, and spaCy for interpreting natural language input.

## Features

- **Text-based Commands**: Type simple commands like `move left`, `move right`, `jump`, `change color`, and `exit` to control the circle.
- **Sound Feedback**: Every action is followed by a sound to make the game more engaging.
